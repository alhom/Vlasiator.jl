# Examples

## Loading VLSV data

- Read meta data
```
filename = "bulk.0000004.vlsv"
meta = read_meta(filename)
```

- Display all variable names
```
vars = show_variables(meta)
```

- Read variable
```
data = read_variable(meta, "proton/vg_rho")
```

The same interface works for both DCCRG grid and FS grid variables.
By default the returned DCCRG grid variable array is sorted by cell IDs.
If in any case you want the original unsorted version as being stored in the file,
simply say `read_variable(meta, var, false)`.

- Get variable at a given location (This can be simplified even further later!)
```
loc = [2.0, 0.0, 0.0]
id = get_cellid(meta, loc)
read_variable_select(meta, "proton/vg_rho", id)
```

- Get variable along a line between two points
```
point1 = [12Re, 0, 0]
point2 = [15Re, 0, 0]
cellids, distances, coords = get_cell_in_line(meta, point1, point2)
```

Combined with external packages like [FieldTracer.jl](https://github.com/henry2004y/FieldTracer.jl), it is possible to do all kinds of in-depth analysis.
More examples can be found in the [repo](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/tree/master/src/examples).

## Computing derived quantities

There are some predefined methods for computing derived quantities such as plasma Î², velocity parallel/perpendicular to the magnetic field, pressure tensor with the third axis aligned with the magnetic field direction and so on.
To compute such, for example, 
```
beta = get_variable_derived(meta, "beta")
```

A full list of available quantities can be found in [vlsvvariables.jl](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/tree/master/src/vlsv/vlsvvariables.jl).

!!! warning
    This part has not been carefully tested so it might not work or just generate wrong results!

## Plotting

Vlasiator.jl does not have any plotting library as dependency, but it offers plotting functionalities through additional scripts.
To use a specific plotting library, just include the target script (e.g. `pyplot.jl`) under `src/plot` folder:
```
include("src/plot/pyplot.jl")
```

Currently I would recommend using `PyPlot.jl`.
`Plots.jl` is catching up, but it is still slower and lack of features.
`Makie.jl` will be supported in the future if 3D plotting is necessary.

More examples of customized plots can be found in the [repo](https://github.com/henry2004y/Vlasiator.jl/tree/master/src/examples).

### PyPlot Backend

- Scaler colored contour for 2D simulation
```
plot_pcolormesh(meta, "rho")
```

- Vector z component colored contour for 2D simulation
```
plot_pcolormesh(meta, "rho", op="z", islinear=false, axisunit="Re")
```

- Derived quantity colored contour for 2D simulation (as long as the input variable is in the predefined dictionary)
```
plot_pcolormesh(meta, "b", op="z", islinear=false, axisunit="Re")
```

- Streamline for 2D simulation
```
streamline(meta, "rho_v", comp="xy")
```

The `comp` option is used to specify the two vector components.

!!! note
    Currently there is limited support for derived variables. This will be expanded and changed later for ease of use!

You can choose to use linear/log color scale, plot vector components via e.g. `op="x"` or magnitude by default, and set unit via `axisunit="Re"` etc..

- Cut slice colored contour for 3D simulation
```
plot_colormap3dslice(meta, "proton/vg_rho", normal="y")
```

### Plots.jl Backend

- Scaler colored contour for 2D simulation
```
heatmap(meta, "rho", aspect_ratio=:equal, c=:turbo)
```

- Scaler colored contour with lines for 2D simulation
```
contourf(meta, "rho)
```

This backend supports all available attributes provided by Plots.jl.
